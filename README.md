# Assignment-6-BMI-Calculator
Creating a New Java Project: start by creating a new Java project in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In this case, IntelliJ IDEA was used.

Configuring JavaFX: configure the project to use JavaFX, which is essential for building Java applications with graphical user interfaces.

Initializing a GitHub Repository: By initializing a GitHub repository for your project, you can version control your code and collaborate with others, which is a good practice for any software development project.

User Interface Design:

Designing the User Interface: Using JavaFX Scene Builder or coding directly in Java, you design the user interface for the BMI Calculator. This involves creating text fields for weight and height input, buttons for calculations, labels to display results, and layout components to arrange them neatly.
BMI Calculation:

Implementing BMI Calculation: You implement the logic for calculating BMI based on the user's weight and height input. The BMI formula is applied, taking into account whether the user prefers English or metric units. The calculated BMI is displayed in the UI.
BMI Status:

Determining BMI Status: You determine the user's BMI status based on the calculated BMI. This involves setting up conditions to categorize the BMI as "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight," or "Obese" according to established guidelines.
Menu Implementation:

Adding a Menu Bar: To enhance user interaction, you add a menu bar at the top of the application. This includes "File" and "Help" menus. The "File" menu provides options for exiting the application and clearing input fields, while the "Help" menu can display information on how to use the BMI calculator.
Documentation:

Code Comments: You provide clear and concise comments in your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each class and method. This makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand your code.
